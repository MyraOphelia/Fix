If your undergraduate course fee is RM 6000 for 3 years with a 10% discount per year, the calculation for the discounted total fee would be as follows:

Base Fee: RM 6000 (for 1 year)

Discount: 10% per year for 3 years

Let's break down the calculation:

Year 1: Full fee of RM 6000
Year 2: Fee after 10% discount = RM 6000 - (10% of RM 6000) = RM 6000 - RM 600 = RM 5400
Year 3: Fee after 10% discount = RM 6000 - RM 600 = RM 5400
To calculate the total discounted fee for 3 years:

Total Fee=Year 1 Fee + Year 2 Fee + Year 3 Fee

Total Fee=Year 1 Fee+ Year 2 Fee+ Year 3 Fee

Total Fee =5400 + 5400 + 5400
Total Fee = 16800

So, the total discounted fee for the undergraduate course over 3 years, with a 10% discount per year, would be RM 16,800.
